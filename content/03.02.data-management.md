#### PHIS 

The Hybrid Phenotyping Information System ([PHIS](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.15385)), based on the [OpenSILEX](https://github.com/OpenSILEX/) framework, assumes responsibility for the systematic collection and management of data from phenotyping and high-throughput phenotyping experiments on a day-to-day basis. PHIS has the ability to efficiently store, organize and manage a wide range of data sets, including images, spectra and growth curves. This functionality extends to data at multiple spatial and temporal scales, from leaf to canopy, from a variety of sources such as field and greenhouse environments.

A key feature of PHIS is the unambiguous identification of all objects and traits within an experiment, establishing consistent relationships between them through the application of ontologies and semantics. This approach is designed to adapt to variations in experimental conditions, whether in the field or in controlled environments. PHIS's ontology-driven architecture emerges as a robust tool for integrating and managing data derived from diverse experiments and platforms, facilitating the creation of meaningful relationships between objects and augmenting datasets with relevant knowledge and metadata.

Furthermore, PHIS adheres to the Minimal Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment ([MIAPPE](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.16544)) and the Breeding API (BrAPI) standards. 

The system recommends specific naming conventions, fostering a standardized approach for users to declare their resources. Notably, PHIS is widely adopted by various experimental platforms of the national [PHENOME](https://www.phenome-emphasis.fr/) and European [EMPHASIS](https://emphasis.plant-phenotyping.eu/) infrastructure, serving as a hub for data management. 
Moreover, dedicated instances of PHIS have been established for the explicit purpose of resource sharing, encompassing projects, genetic resources, and variables, thereby fostering collaborative engagement and the dissemination of knowledge pertaining to studied concepts.

##### PHIS & BrAPI

PHIS offers a RESTful API designed to streamline interaction with data within a platform. Within this API, various services aligning with the Breeding API (BrAPI) standards have been implemented, encompassing the Core, Phenotyping, and Germplasm modules. Comprehensive documentation for these services is available on the PHIS Swagger interface. This integration with Swagger ensures that users can easily access, understand, and utilize the functionalities provided by the BrAPI-compliant web services, fostering transparency and facilitating effective engagement with the PHIS platform.

The design and development of PHIS have been meticulously tailored, incorporating the explicit constraint of aligning with BrAPI requirements. This intentional alignment ensures that PHIS adheres to the specified standards and protocols outlined by the Breeding API (BrAPI), thereby fostering seamless integration and compatibility with BrAPI-compliant systems and platforms. This prerequisite served as a substantial foundation for formalizing the data model, simultaneously facilitating compatibility with other standards, such as MIAPPE. Thus, by consciously incorporating BrAPI requirements into its structure, PHIS not only meets the phenotyping domain standards but also enhances its capacity for interoperability and effective collaboration within the broader context of plant breeding and related domains.

The fact that data within a PHIS instance can be queried through BrAPI services makes the indexing of PHIS in [FAIDARE](https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/faidare/) very easy to implement.

Indeed, as PHIS offers BrAPI-compliant Web Services, this greatly simplifies the integration and data exchange with other European information systems that handle phenotyping data. The adherence to BrAPI standards ensures a common interface and compatibility, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration between PHIS and other systems within the European context. This interoperability not only streamlines data sharing but also promotes a more cohesive and effective approach to managing and utilizing phenotyping data across diverse platforms and research initiatives in the European scientific community.

#### DeltaBreed

<!-- Shawn Y.-->
DeltaBreed is an open-source data management system designed and developed by Breeding Insight to support USDA-ARS specialty crop and animal breeders. DeltaBreed is a unified system for managing breeding data that connects a variety of BrAPI applications (see list below). BrAPI integration allows the complexity underlying interoperability to be hidden, shielding users from multifactorial differences between diverse applications. DeltaBreed, adhering to the BrAPI model, establishes data standards and validations for users and provides a singular framework for data management and user training.

DeltaBreed users need not be aware of BrAPI or the specifics of underlying applications but will notice that BrAPI interoperability reduces the need for human-mediated file transfers and data manipulation. Field Book users, for example, can connect to their DeltaBreed program, authenticate, and pull studies and traits directly from DeltaBreed to Field Book on their data collection device. The subsequent step of pushing observations from Field Book to DeltaBreed is straightforward via BrAPI, but will not be implemented until repeated observation handling workflows are established to differentiate and validate repeated observations, such as accidental repeats, overwrite requests, time-series observations, and repeated sub-entity measures. Users can expect DeltaBreed observation handling to become more seamless with future development.

##### Case Study - USDA ARS Poplarville Blueberry Breeding Program Phenotyping
The 2021 season for Poplarville Blueberry was the first time DeltaBreed, Breedbase, and FieldBook were 
integrated to support a phenotyping data collection effort with all data transfers performed via BrAPI 
rather than spreadsheets. DeltaBreed was used to manage and load ontology terms  into Breedbase via BrAPI. Breedbase 
was used to load germplasm, setup experiments, generate QR code labels, and store observation 
data. Field Book was used to pull experiment data from Breedbase and push collected observation data back via BrAPI.

This effort served as a successful example and proof of concept of the capabilities of systems integrated via BrAPI for 
phenotypic data collection. However, it also highlighted some additional considerations and the need for further 
development. Blueberry, being a perennial, has different considerations in experiment management than annuals. Tracking the 
same plant over many years and associating collected data is a special consideration vs annuals where all observation units
can be newly created every year without the need for year to year linking. With data going directly into Breedbase from 
FieldBook a quality control step that may have been previously done in the spreadsheet data was now missing. Either the 
experiment data could be recreated and cleaned or a data staging area could be developed that allows for pending 
observation data. Multiple measurements were possible as Breedbase saved observations with the same observation unit and 
variable as unique if the timestamps were different. To use this the field was deleted and reloaded in FieldBook after 
the first set of observations were made and uploaded. A need to improve this scheme to improve usability and robustness 
was identified. In addition to field plant data, berry data measurements from penetrometer, discrete analyzer, and scale 
instruments also had to be stored. These sub-observation datasets need to be linked to the top-level plant they are 
associated with which was another area identified as needing development. Most of these identified area for improvement 
are being addressed in DeltaBreed.
